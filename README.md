# Discord Active Developer Badge Template Bot.

You can use this to get yourself the Discord Active Developer badge quickly, with no need to know anything about programming.

To start the proccess, you must make sure you have Python 3.9 installed (Some of the newer versions may require you to have VBS installed, but the 3.9 version has been tested and it works with no added software).

Once ready, either double click on ```main.py``` or open up a Terminal/Command prompt/Powershell, navigate to the cloned directory, and run the following command:

```python main.py```

Once you've done that, all of the requirements will be installed, and you will be asked to put in your bot's token.

#NOTE: This bot is reusable!

Once you've finished the initial setup, if you find yourself interested in developing discord bots, you can modify the ``bot.py`` file, and you can start the bot again by running main.py, and it will run with no need to go through the setup again.


# This will be kept updated if any of the requirements are changed.
